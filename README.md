Sublime-Logos
=============

Logos syntax highlighter for Sublime Text.

Stick the .tmLanguage file in `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/User` and reload Sublime (close and reopen). You should now have syntax highlighting for logos.

* It could be better, a lot better. I do not know regexes enough to fix it, but if anyone feels like contributing, it would be appreciated.
